<b>Student Member Alumni: </b> User-Centric Computing Group aims to bridge mutually beneficial connections between current students members and former members, where all former members provide free portals for internship recommendations, research collaborations and graduate application guidance. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Student Trainee Alumni:</b> User-Centric Computing Group also feels grateful for past trainees, who have faiths in our group, but left out of diverse reasons. We keep all hard-working, honoest and sincere student trainees in mind and wish them the best in the future.
