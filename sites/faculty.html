<b>Faculty Advisors: </b>  A broad and interdisciplinary group of Faculties are the guarantee of proper guidance in research activities within User-Centric Computing Group. We emphasize the importance of advising and mentoring, as well as external collaborations (e.g. visiting, internships and etc.), to expand the vision of our group and deepen the understanding of relevant concepts and techniques. Also, all faculty advisors appreciate and share the values of User-Centric Computing Group and help students as much as they could.
</p>
<p>
<b>Disclaimer for Students:</b> All internal and external faculty advisors manages and led their own research groups, and User-Centric Computing Group doesn't position itself as an independent research group but a student organization for regular seminars, training projects and brainstorms/discussions. Hence, it's not necessary to involve irrelevant group members while doing your own research/submitting your own papers, but collaborations have been highly encouraged of course.
